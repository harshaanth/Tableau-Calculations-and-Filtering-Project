# Purpose of the Project

This project is designed to teach advanced Tableau skills, such as:

Applying filters to the data to focus on specific subsets.
Using calculated fields to manipulate data.
Creating running totals and rank orders for better insights.
It provides practical knowledge on how to enhance data analysis using Tableau’s filtering and calculation capabilities.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the following files:
- `Calcs_HarshaanthKumar_ThiyagarajaKumar.twbx`: Tableau packaged workbook containing advanced visualizations that incorporate calculations, filters, and running totals.
- `Orders2012-2015.xlsx`: The dataset used in the Tableau workbook, containing order data from 2012 to 2015.
- `Assignment_2_Instructions.pdf`: Detailed instructions for creating visualizations using filtering, logic, and calculations.

### Files Overview

1. **Tableau Workbook (`Calcs_HarshaanthKumar_ThiyagarajaKumar.twbx`)**:
   This workbook is divided into three sections, each focusing on different Tableau functionalities:

   - **Section 1: Working with Filters**
     1. Basic Filters
     2. Top Ten Filter
     3. Condition Filter
     
   - **Section 2: Basic Calculations**
     1. Contains() Function
     2. If() Logic
     3. Profit Ratio Calculation
     4. Concatenating Strings
     5. DateDiff() Calculation
     
   - **Section 3: Running Totals**
     1. Percent of Total (Across)
     2. Percent of Total (Down)
     3. Percent of Total (Entire Table)
     4. Running Total (Across)
     5. Running Total for West Region
     6. Running Total for Home Office (2014)
     7. Rank Orders by Top Sales
     8. Rank Orders by Top Sales (by Region)
     9. Rank Orders by Top Sales (Different Table Format)
     10. Difference in Sales from Previous Month
     11. Difference in Sales for Every Month (starting January 2012)
     12. Year-over-Year Growth (% Difference for Same Period in Prior Year)

   Each worksheet corresponds to the task instructions in the PDF file and demonstrates how to use filters, logic, and calculations to manipulate the data and create meaningful visualizations.

2. **Excel Dataset (`Orders2012-2015.xlsx`)**:
   The Excel dataset contains sales order data from 2012 to 2015. Fields include Order Date, Region, Segment, Product Category, Sales, Profit, and more. This dataset is used for creating all the visualizations, applying filters, and performing calculations.

3. **Assignment Instructions (`Assignment_2_Instructions.pdf`)**:
   The PDF outlines the detailed steps required to complete the assignment. It includes the following sections:
   - **Section 1: Filters** – Instructions for applying different filters to refine the dataset.
   - **Section 2: Calculations** – Guide on how to create and use calculated fields to manipulate data.
   - **Section 3: Running Totals** – Steps to create running totals and percentage-based calculations.
